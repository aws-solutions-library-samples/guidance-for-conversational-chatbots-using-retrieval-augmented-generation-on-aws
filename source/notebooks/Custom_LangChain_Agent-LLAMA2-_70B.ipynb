INTRODUCTION Employees in titles represented by unions that have collectively bargained an agreement to opt into New York State Paid Family Leave Benefits will be eligible to take paid family leave (“PFL”). PFL is an employee-funded insurance policy that provides job-protected, paid time-off to bond with a newly born, adopted, or foster child, to care for a family member with a serious health condition, including preparation and recovery from surgery related to organ or tissue donation, or to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed in a foreign country on active military service. Each Collective Bargaining Unit (CBU) has a specific effective date for this benefit. Please refer to the attachment “List of Covered Unions” for eligibility dates. 2.

In California, there is a Paid Family Leave (PFL) program that provides up to 6 weeks of paid leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, including a new child.
